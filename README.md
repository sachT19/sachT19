# Hi there, I'm Sachleen! 

I'm a 💛rising senior💛 at the <a href = "https://imsa.edu/">Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy</a>, and I'm interested in 💛clinical informatics💛 and in finding ways that patient care can be improved. 

My GitHub mainly has some of my school and research projects that I've worked on throughout my high school career.
