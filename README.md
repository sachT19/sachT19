# Hi there, I'm Sachleen! 

I'm a senior at the <a href = "https://imsa.edu/">Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy</a>, and I'm interested in clinical informatics and in finding ways that patient care can be improved. 

My GitHub mainly has some of my school and research projects that I've worked on throughout my high school career.
